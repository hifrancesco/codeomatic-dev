  <h1>Containerization and Orchestration</h1>
  <p>
    Containerization and orchestration are two important concepts in modern application deployment and management.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Containerization:</strong> Containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container, which provides a lightweight and portable environment. Tools like Docker facilitate container creation, packaging, and running, making it easier to deploy applications consistently across different environments.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Orchestration:</strong> Orchestration focuses on managing and coordinating multiple containers in a distributed system. Tools like Kubernetes automate container deployment, scaling, and management tasks. They handle container scheduling, load balancing, service discovery, and scaling based on demand, ensuring the reliable and efficient operation of containerized applications.
    <br>
    <br>
    Containerization and orchestration work hand in hand to simplify application deployment, enhance scalability, improve resource utilization, and enable the management of complex distributed systems.
