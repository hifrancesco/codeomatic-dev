    <h1>Key Concepts of OOP</h1>

    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Classes are blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. They are used to create objects of a particular type. A class encapsulates data (in the form of attributes) and behaviors (in the form of methods)
      that define the characteristics and actions of objects.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Objects are instances of classes. They are created from a class and represent specific entities or instances that possess the attributes and behaviors defined by the class. Objects have their own unique state and can interact with
      other objects.
    </p>

    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>
      Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming. It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a class and controlling access to them. Encapsulation provides data hiding and protects
      the internal implementation details of a class, allowing objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>
      Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits is called a subclass or derived class, and the class from which it inherits is called a superclass or base
      class. Inheritance facilitates code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical class structure, where subclasses can inherit and extend the attributes and methods of their superclass.
    </p>

    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>
      Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In the context of OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables the same method to be called on
      different objects, resulting in different behaviors based on the actual class of the object. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.
    </p>

    <p>
      These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming and are essential for building modular, reusable, and maintainable code. They enable developers to model real-world entities, establish relationships between objects,
      and create code that is easier to understand, modify, and scale.
